# Manufacturing instructions for replicating the hydraulic printing module

The hydraulic printing module comprises a reservoir for the actuating fluid, a syringe, the regulation and control components required for each syringe and the covers and supports.

The 3D printed componenents should be printed from thermoplastic material such as PLA on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) printer. This allows to melt insert threads into the components at a later stage. All components that are in close contact with the bioink or the actuation fluid should be printed from biocompatible and sterilisable material such as Stratasys' MED610. For the lid of the reservoir (X) a multi-material technique is necessary to print an elastic seal directly onto the lid. We used a Stratasys Polyjet printer (Objet 350 Connex 3) with MED610 as the material for the lid and Agilus for the seal.
