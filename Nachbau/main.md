# Manufacturing instructions for replicating the hydraulic printing module

The hydraulic printing module comprises a reservoir for the actuating fluid, a syringe and the regulation and control components required for each syringe.

The componenents (8, 11-13, 21-23, 30, 31) should be printed from thermoplastic material such as PLA on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) printer. This allows to melt insert threads into the components at a later stage. All components that are in close contact with the bioink or the actuation fluid (9, 10, 24, 26-29) should be printed from biocompatible and sterilisable material such as Stratasys' MED610. For the lid of the reservoir (25) a multi-material technique is necessary to print an elastic seal directly onto the lid. We used a Stratasys Polyjet printer (Objet 350 Connex 3) with MED610 as the material for the lid and Agilus for the seal.
