# Troubleshooting

## Sealing
The two valves required for the hydraulic pressure module are each mounted in a connection socket in order to control the water flow. It is recommended to apply isopropanol to both the connection socket and the valve when inserting it into the connection socket in order to prevent damage to the O-rings on the valve. Before inserting the valve, it should also be checked that all outlets on the connection socket have been printed correctly and allow water to pass through, as the valve can not be removed from the connection socket without causing damage once it has been inserted.

Tube adapters are installed at various positions in the pressure module to enable the flow of water from components such as the connection sockets or the reservoir into the tubes. For this purpose, the tube adapters are fixed in the components using a thread. Attempts were made to print the hose connection directly onto the corresponding components. However, this either led to clogged connections or to the connections breaking off when the support structures were removed. To ensure a complete sealing between the tube adapter and the corresponding component, it is recommended to use thread sealing tape. In addition, there may still be air pockets in the hoses after assembly, which must be completely removed by test runs so that the flow sensor can perform correct measurements.

Pressure equalization elements
The self-adhesive pressure equalization elements (21) contain a membrane that is permeable to air but not to water. This limited permeability is used for ventilation in the reservoir as well as on the stamp and syringe cap. If possible, the 3D printing of support structures should be avoided on the intended bonding surfaces for the pressure equalization elements in order to obtain a surface that is as flat as possible and therefore ensure the adhesion of the self-adhesive elements. It is also recommended to allow the pressure equalization elements to dry for 24 hours after application and before first use. Repeated use of a pressure equalization element on the stamp and syringe cap has shown that the air permeability decreases significantly as soon as the element comes into contact with liquid. However, after the pressure equalization elements have been left to dry, the air permeability is restored and the element can be used again for venting in the syringe. It is therefore recommended to prepare several stamps and syringe caps with pressure equalization elements.
