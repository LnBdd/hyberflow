# Bioprinting Cartridge

### 3D printing of components

The componenents (x-x) should be printed from thermoplastic material such as PLA on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) printer.
This allows to melt insert threads into the components at a later stage. 
All components that are in close contact with the bioink or the actuation fluid (X-X) should be printed from biocompatible and sterilisable material such as Stratasys' MED610.
For the lid of the reservoir (X) a multi-material technique is necessary to print an elastic seal directly onto the lid.
We used a Stratasys Polyjet printer (Objet 350 Connex 3) with MED610 as the material for the lid and Agilus for the seal. 


### Assembly

- Melt M3 thread inserts into the components X,X,X at the positions indicated in Figure X
- Stick one pressure equalizing membrane each on components X,X,X and the positions indicated in Figure X
- Fit the O-ring XX to component XX
- Fit the O-ring XX to component XX
- Gently insert component X with the O-ring into component X
