# Bioprinting Cartridge

### 3D printing of components

The componenents (x-x) should be printed from thermoplastic material such as PLA on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) printer.
This allows to melt insert threads into the components at a later stage. 
All components that are in close contact with the bioink or the actuation fluid (X-X) should be printed from biocompatible and sterilisable material such as Stratasys' MED610.
For the lid of the reservoir (X) a multi-material technique is necessary to print an elastic seal directly onto the lid.
We used a Stratasys Polyjet printer (Objet 350 Connex 3) with MED610 as the material for the lid and Agilus for the seal.

Cut an M6 thread into the two recesses on the inside of the cover and insert tube adapters using thread sealing tape.

Connect the silicon tubing according to the principle sketch by cutting tube sections of the appropriate length. Y-tube-connectors can be used to connect three tube ends. Connect the end of the tubing coming out of the flow sensor to the upper tube adapter in the cover and the end of the tubing coming out of one of the valve interfaces to the lower tube adapter in the cover. Place micro tube clamps on all tube ends in the system.

Mount the cover to the back wall using four M2,5x8 screws.

- Stick one pressure equalizing membrane each on components X,X,X and the positions indicated in Figure X
- Fit the O-ring XX to component XX
- Fit the O-ring XX to component XX
- Gently insert component X with the O-ring into component X
