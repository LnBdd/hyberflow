# Operating Notes

## Pressure equalization elements
Repeated use of a pressure equalization element on the stamp and syringe cap has shown that the air permeability decreases significantly as soon as the element comes into contact with liquid. However, after the pressure equalization elements have been able to dry, the air permeability is restored and the element can be used again for venting in the syringe. It is therefore recommended to change the stamp and syringe cap after each printing cycle.

## Stamp
The stamp, which separates the bioink from the actuating liquid in the syringe, is placed on the bio-ink when preparing the printing module for a printing cycle. It has been shown that the pressure equalization elements allow air to escape, but the syringe must be held exactly vertically so that the air escapes centrally and no air bubbles remain. It is therefore recommended to place the syringe upright in a holding device during assembly.

## Hydraulic quick release
The actuating fluid must be led through the printing module cover from the reservoir to the control components on the one hand and from the control components to the syringe cap on the other. As this is done using tube connections that have to be disconnected several times during use, hydraulic quick releases are used at these positions in the tube system. The two parts of the quick release coupling can be connected or disconnected during (dis)assembly using a push/pull mechanism. It should be noted that only one side of the quick release seals when it is opened. The hose clips should therefore be closed first before the coupling is opened.

## Flow sensor
When using the flow sensor, it should be noted that a biofilm or other deposits can build up at the measuring point over time, which could affect the measurements and therefore the entire control system. It is therefore recommended to work with sterile water as the actuating fluid and to replace it in regular intervals. The manufacturer also recommends removing the liquid from the tube system, blowing out the sensor with air and positioning it upright if no printing cycle and therefore no measurement is carried out for a longer period of time. In addition, the sensor can be rinsed with isopropanol in regular intervals or the isopropanol can be left in the flow channel overnight and rinsed out the next day. Further detailed information on cleaning the flow sensor can be found [here](https://github.com/Jhundertmark/Hydraulic_Printing_Module/blob/main/Dokumente/Liquid_Flow_AN_Cleaning_and_Clean_Handling.pdf).
