# Operating Notes

## Pressure equalization elements
Repeated use of a pressure equalization element on the stamp and syringe cap has shown that the air permeability decreases significantly as soon as the element comes into contact with liquid. However, after the pressure equalization elements have been able to dry, the air permeability is restored and the element can be used again for venting in the syringe. It is therefore recommended to change the stamp and syringe cap after each printing cycle.

## Stamp
The stamp, which separates the bio-ink from the actuating liquid in the syringe, is placed on the bio-ink when preparing the printing module for a printing cycle. It has been shown that the pressure equalization elements allow air to escape, but the syringe must be held exactly vertically so that the air escapes centrally and no air bubbles remain. It is therefore recommended to place the syringe upright in a holding device during assembly.
