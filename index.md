# HYPBERFLOW - a novel hydraulically actuated open source bioextrusion printhead
HYPBERFLOW is an printhead for bioextrusion applications and was developed at the Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover by the [Institute for Mechatronic Systems](https://www.imes.uni-hannover.de/en/). 

This documentation enables you to rebuild the system and integrate it in your bioprinter setup. We provide an example code to interface the module through a serial commincation. Since the control of the actual extrusion of the module is done by an onboard microcontroller, mulitple modules can be interfaced and operated simultaniously. 

## Citing

The HYPBERFLOW was first presented and evaluated in an XX paper, which is freely available. If you use parts of this project for your reserach, please cite the publication:
